R Statistics Demo
=================

The accompanying R code gives a demonstration of data manipulation, graphics, and statistical procedures. The outputs contain data displays (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots) and statistical analysis (categorical data analysis, tTest for comparison of means, linear regression).  

The data correspond to the following variables and descriptions.  

* **id** for *Identification Number*  
*  **age** for *Age* (in years)  
*  **fev** for *Forced Expiratory Volume* (in liters)  
*  **height** for *Height* (in inches)  
*  **sex** for *Sex* ('male' or 'female')  
*  **smoke** for *Smoking Status* ('non-current smoker' or 'current smoker')  

The data was obtained from B. Rosner's book *Introduction to Biostatistics*.
